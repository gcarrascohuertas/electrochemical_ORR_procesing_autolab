# ORR reaction in electrochemistry

Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is also the most important reaction in life processes. In aqueous media occurs mainly by two pathways: the direct 4-electron reduction pathway from O2 to H2O, and the 2-electron reduction pathway from O2
to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).

# ORR reaction in the laboratory

Most common technique for ORR studies is cyclic voltammetry using rotating disk electrode (RDE), and rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE).
