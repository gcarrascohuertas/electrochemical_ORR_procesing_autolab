# Electrochemical setup

- Nitrogen and Oxygen gas cylinder (e.g. https://www.airliquide.com )
- Rotating disk electrode equipment (e.g. https://www.metrohm.com/en/products/AUTRDES )
- Three-electrode jacket cell with two-way gas purge
- Potentiostat (e.g. Autolab PGSTAT302N - High Performance , https://www.metrohm-autolab.com/Products/Echem/NSeriesFolder/PGSTAT302N )
- PC with electrochemical adquisition software (e.g. NOVA software,  https://metrohm-autolab.com/Products/Echem/Software/Nova.html )

- Three-electrode cell

    - Platinum mesh as counter electrode (CE)
    - Ag/AgCl/KCl (3.5M) as reference electrode (RE)
    - Your working electrode (WE). Here I used a carbon slurry deposited over polished rotating-glassy carbon electrode (GC, 4 mm diameter). Carbon slurry consist in 5 mg (carbon  material after going through a 150 microns sieve), ethanol (170 µl) and Nafion 117 (5 wt%, 47.5 µl). Slurry was sonicated for 5 minutes and then was drop-coated (7 µl of the slurry) over rotating-disk tip (try to fullfill all the glassy carbon active area.


- Electrolyte
    - Here you can use different electrolytes (e.g. 0.1 M KOH, H2SO4 , HClO4, etc..) 


# Electrochemical technique

Electrochemical tecnique performed is cyclic voltammograms (CV). Potential window have to be ranged in the optimum potential windows of your electrode-electrolyte system. 

In the example provided here I used a potential window which vary from 0.1 to -0.9 V reapeated 3 times at 10 mV/s fixed scan rate.


# Electrochemical measurements

In order to follow recomendatios of https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12678-017-0378-6#citeas , first the electrolyte is thermostated at 298 K and then purged with high purity Nitrogen for at least 30 min prior to Nitrogen measurement. Once nitrogen measurements are achieved electrolyte is purged with Oxygen for at least 30 min prior to Oxygen measurements.
