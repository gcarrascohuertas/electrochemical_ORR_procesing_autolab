- Three-electrode setup

    - Platinum mesh as counter electrode (CE)
    - Ag/AgCl/KCl (3.5M) as reference electrode (RE)
    - Your working electrode (WE). Here I used a carbon deposited WE which consist in 5 mg (grounded material after going through a 150 microns sieve), ethanol (170 µl) and Nafion 117 (5 wt%, 47.5 µl, from Sigma Aldrich) + sonication for 5 minutes. Then the polished glassy carbon (GC) rotating-disk tip (4 mm in diameter) is coated twice – by drop-casting – with 3.5 µl of the slurry.
