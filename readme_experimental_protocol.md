- Three-electrode setup

    - Platinum mesh as counter electrode (CE)
    - Ag/AgCl/KCl (3.5M) as reference electrode (RE)
    - Your working electrode (WE). Here I used a carbon slurry deposited over polished rotating-glassy carbon electrode (GC, 4 mm diameter). Carbon slurry consist in 5 mg (carbon  material after going through a 150 microns sieve), ethanol (170 µl) and Nafion 117 (5 wt%, 47.5 µl). Slurry was sonicated for 5 minutes and then was drop-coated (7 µl of the slurry) over rotating-disk tip (try to fullfill all the glassy carbon active area.
