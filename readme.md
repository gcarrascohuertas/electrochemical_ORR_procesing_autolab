# Electrochemical ORR reaction fit tools in Python

# Description

ORR reaction is one of the most important of all electrochemical reactions. Unfortunately, experimental research is really complicated due to lack of standarization. 
This project aim to provide quick-tools developed in Python for ORR data treatment base on data adquisition recomendations described in scientific article (doi https://doi.org/10.1007/s12678-017-0378-6).

# Additional coments

The Electrochemical ORR reaction fit tools in Python version is still in it's beta state. This means that it can have some bugs and issues. However, testing and contributing is very welcome.
